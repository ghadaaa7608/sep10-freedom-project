# Entry 1: Choosing Archaeology As My Topic
---
##### 10/7/24

The topic I decided to do for the freedom project is **archaeology**, since I've been so facinated in it for the past few years from watching shows like one piece, taking classes like ancient world literature, and just being interested in ancient artifacts generally. I mean, it is pretty obvious that if you want to be an archaeologist, you're going to have use some advanced technology to discover some _ancient artifacts or writings_. I already knew that I wanted archaeology as my topic because, I've been a big history person since kindergarden, everything about artifacts and stuff just seemed so interesting. 

Some websites that I've found pretty useful so far were  https://(crowcanyon.org)/education/learn-about-archaeology/science-technology-in-archaeology and https://www.(captechu.edu)/blog/how-ai-and-technology-is-revolutionizing-archeology. The first website gave me some info on what technology is used to identify artifacts like microscopes. While the second link taught me how AI can be used to create 3D models for archaeologists.
