# Entry 1: Choosing Archaeology As My Topic
---
##### 10/7/24

The topic I decided to do for the freedom project is **archaeology**, since I've been so facinated in it for the past few years from watching shows like one piece, taking classes like ancient world literature, and just being interested in ancient artifacts generally. I mean, it is pretty obvious that if you want to be an archaeologist, you're going to have use some advanced technology to discover some _ancient artifacts or writings_. I already knew that I wanted archaeology as my topic because, I've been a big history person since kindergarden, everything about artifacts and stuff just seemed so interesting. 

Some of the websites that I've found pretty useful so far was https://www.(crowcanyon.org)/education/learn-about-archaeology/science-technology-in-archaeology/ and https://www.(captechu.edu)/blog/how-ai-and-technology-is-revolutionizing-archeology. The first website gave me some info on what technology is used to identify artifacts like microscopes. While the second link taught me how AI can be used to create 3D models for archaeologists.

As of right now, I have so far looked through what topics interested me like archaeology as I said previously, architecture, and hospitality. But like I said before I finally decided on doing archaeology for my freedom project. Then I did some research on how archaeology ties in with **_technology/computer science/software/ect_**. I found out all sorts of cool website with info on archaeology and tech like I had mentioned in the intro, so that kind of gave me a good gist on what this freedom project will exactly gonna be on.

## Skills

A Certain skill I've learned to take note on coincidently is literally taking notes. I've already written so many notes in my SEP notes doc for the year, and I gotta say that it's helped a lot. Its helped me with memorizing what we've done throughout the beginning of september up until unit 1, and I know for sure that it'll help me in the future if I've lost track and need to catch up. I've also learned through past students in SEP who took hundreds of notes when they weren't catched up, and they ended up being just fine. 

Another skill that I've learned to keep in mind is organization, which kind of ties in note taking. While I take notes, I've learned s about organization through indented bullet points, highlighting , _italic_ , **bold**, ect. Let me tell you, these ways literally changed my perspective on note taking and on how to be an organized person, without them I would've done regular bulleted points.
