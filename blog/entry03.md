## How Did I Brainstorm Future Archaeological Inventions
I first brainstormed my future archaeological inventions by thinking about what archaeologists still need/have a disadavantage of, so I kept thinking about these 3 things:
* AI
* Holograms
* Robots
I also looked back at the already existing inventions that I already put down in my [SEP notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBU2sZEM4YFTHtE91UQto2EUElyU7UPzGTHyff7rLcI/edit?tab=t.0), which is how I created the 3 following inventions:
* An Ancient AI-translator
* An Ancient AI-art creator
* And A Robotic Excavator
I thought of the first one due to thinking about how we already have google translate, but it isn't really a proper translation of languages most of the time. I also thought about how historical linguists still have so many ancient languages that they don't know how to read, teach, or speak in properly. So boom an ancient AI-translator. I thought of the second one by thinking about all this AI art pieces/videos that have been going around, and I thought that could really tie into historical events or people that we don't know anything about. I also thought about how this art could educate people on this person or event as well, which is how I thought of an ancient AI-art creator. Now finally for my third invention, this was the one where I looked through my archaeological hardware, and I was just thinking "_have I done a hologram yet?_". I realized that I didn't, and I saw how everybody else was doing holograms, so that's how the hologram part tied in. I also was just thinking about how the invention would actually help in the real world through educating and giving archaeologists more experience, and that's how it came out to be.
## How Did I Finalize All Of My Content?
The way I finalized it if you would say was that during one freedom monday, I had to organize all my notes from the **_Archaeological Software/Hardware_** into all different types  of sections, so I organized it like this:
* Most Commonly/Recently Used Software/Hardware
* Software/Hardware Used To Save Time
* And Software/Hardware That Has A Specific Use
This was since I saw all these specific patterns throughout the **_Archaeological Software/Hardware_** notes, I had also done a do now that day where we organized vehicles into different groups so that it would kinda help or guide me a bit. I had also done the **_Intro/Context/Overview_** and **_Future Archaeological Inventions_** prior to the previous part, so when I was done with all my notes that I'd gotten from both parts, it was then time to put it all into one doc for all the information for my website. I already had everything in my freedom project section in my notes-- I pretty much had to copy and paste everything into the doc, but I had it in this order because it just made sense:
* **_Intro/Context/Overview_**
* **_Archaeological Software/Hardware_**
***_Future Archaeological Inventions_**

## Engineering Design Process
The first thing I did for my EDP was chose what my topic is which is obviously archaeology, I then did a bit of research on _how archaeology connects with SEP_. After that there was researching the _archaeological software/apps_, which I kinda did when I researched how SEP connects with archaeology, I also took some notes from the apps I reviewed. Then I did my research on _archaeological hardware/tools_, and I also took notes on the websites I used to get information on them. I then organized all notes from here by putting the software/hardware that I had into different categories, which turned into **_Archaeological Software/Hardware_**. Also while I did that, there was making the **_Intro/Context/Overview_**. Then I started making my **_Future Archaeological Inventions_**, along with adding the images, and links to the images of the hardware since that was what I had to fix for my notes on **_Archaeological Software/Hardware_**. And the last thing I did this year for my EDP, I had to put all this information into one google doc which was for all the content I'll be providing for now on my webpage.
## Skills
One of the skills I've gained during this unit is really taking the time to organize my notes into different categories since that's what we had to do during one of the classes, and I've done it so much throughout this unit, especially during these lessons of learning about the CLI, and it's taken me some getting used to because organization isn't easy. But I would say that it's become a pretty big skill of mine, and I'll will definitely continue to do this throughout my future in SEP since it'll be for the sake of my final website in the end. 

Another one of my skills is really just locking in whenever I have a short assignment or when I have a big write up/blog like this one! I've really found myself in a whole editing cave, or just in a different world through being that one studious kid that everybody asks the answers from. This is because I've literally have so much ease in just locking in for a good minute or 2 to finish up an assignment because me personally, that's just how I've been getting my assignments done faster instead of just finishing one part of it, then waiting the next day to finish it up. I also waste less time whenever I lock in.

The last skill I'd like to mention is definitely how I've taken the creative rains because it helped me think of all these different categories and way to organize my notes, and how it especially helped me for my last part of my content for my website this year since in order to think of future inventions for the topic you love, you obviously have to dig deep into your brain. It's also is such an easy skill because we all have our own aspirations/ interests and ideas, so we're all creative in our ways. This was literally why I chose archhaeology because it was my own topic that I was interested in every since I was a kid.
## Summary
To sum this up, I really hope that I'm gonna take good care of this website and pretty much do it justice, but not just for me. This website is for all the archaeologists out there, and I hope that this makes the students who view this website interested in history as a topic. I just really hope that I'm gonna end up ok in the end by the end of this class since it was a lot more difficult than I thought, but as long as I have Allah by my side, I'll be okay.
