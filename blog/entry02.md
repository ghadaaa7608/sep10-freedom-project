# Entry 2: Researching Archaeology 
##### 11/4/24
### What did I find + How did I find it?
So far I've found a few **_Archaeology apps, and some Archaeological hardware/gadgets_**. I found these apps or hardware/gadgets throughout searching up stuff like "_Archaeology software this year, Archaeology software IOS this year, Archaeological hardware, Archaeological gadgets, and What kind of devices do people in archaeology use?_"
#### Archaeology Apps
I actually found out that one of the good apps to use for archaeology is [github](https://github.com/zackbatist/open-archaeo) because:
* This could be a great app to make writeups.
  * Like this one!
* This can be used to take notes.
* And it can be used to make important labeled folders.
I found this app through searching up "_Archaeology software this year_".
Another app I found pretty useful in archaeology is [heritagedaily](https://www.heritagedaily.com/application) because:
* This app is good for online public news of archaeological and heritage discoveries.
* And it brings rich and diverse content with just a touch of your finger tips.
And I found this app through searching up "_Archaeology software IOS this year_".
#### Archaeology Software
So when I searched up "_Archaeological hardware_", I found out that:
* Trowels are the most iconic and most often used tool in archaeology from [histarch.illinois.edu](http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/np/tools.html)
* And a total station is an electronic instrument thatâ€™s used to measure angles and distances, specifically for slopes from [zagoraarchaeologicalproject.org](https://zagoraarchaeologicalproject.org/the-project/archaeological-field-tools-and-methods/)
When I searched up  "_Archaeological gadgets_", I found out that:
