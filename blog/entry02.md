# Entry 2: Researching Archaeology 
##### 11/4/24
### What did I find + How did I find it?
So far I've found a few **_Archaeology apps, and some Archaeological hardware/gadgets_**. I found these apps or hardware/gadgets throughout searching up stuff like "_Archaeology software this year, Archaeology software IOS this year, Archaeological hardware, Archaeological gadgets, and What kind of devices do people in archaeology use?_"
#### Archaeology Apps
I actually found out that one of the good apps to use for archaeology is [github](https://github.com/zackbatist/open-archaeo) because:
* This could be a great app to make writeups.
  * Like this one!
* This can be used to take notes.
* And it can be used to make important labeled folders.
I found this app through searching up "_Archaeology software this year_".
Another app I found pretty useful in archaeology is [heritagedaily](https://www.heritagedaily.com/application) because:
* This app is good for online public news of archaeological and heritage discoveries.
* And it brings rich and diverse content with just a touch of your finger tips.
And I found this app through searching up "_Archaeology software IOS this year_".
#### Archaeology Hardware
So when I searched up "_Archaeological hardware_", I found out that:
* Trowels are the most iconic and most often used tool in archaeology from [histarch.illinois.edu](http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/np/tools.html)
* And a total station is an electronic instrument that’s used to measure angles and distances, specifically for slopes from [zagoraarchaeologicalproject.org](https://zagoraarchaeologicalproject.org/the-project/archaeological-field-tools-and-methods/)
When I searched up  "_Archaeological gadgets_", I found out that:
* Digital technology actually saves big amounts of time and limits digging.
* VR recreations help bring the past to life.
  * Both of these are from [princeton.edu](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2024/04/09/princeton-archaeologists-are-using-cutting-edge-digital-technologies-help-reveal)
* Shovels, trowels, spades, brushes, sieves, and buckets are some of the common tools that an archaeologist may carry with them for digging.
* Tool types differ depending on what type of excavation is being done.
  * And both of these are from [sandiearchaeology.org](https://sandiegoarchaeology.org/dig-deeper-what-tools-do-archaeologists-use/)
And for my last search which was "_What kind of devices do people in archaeology use?_", I found out that:
* Geophysical survey is one of the ways to investigate archeological sites before, or instead of, testing and excavation.
* Remote sensing helps archaeologists with deciding where to dig, or deciding if excavation is necessary.
  * These were both found on [history.nebraska.gov](https://history.nebraska.gov/technology-in-archeology/)
* And Dentil Picks can actually be used to clean the dirt from small artifacts from [www.in.gov](https://www.in.gov/dnr/historic-preservation/files/matching.pdf).
### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
So far, in my Engineering Design Process, I figured out what topic I will be doing for the freedom project, being archaeology, searching up how it connected with SEP related things. I have now done tons of google searches about both **_archaeological software/apps, and hardware/gadgets_**, and I also took lots of notes throughout my google searching on the [SEP10 NOTES](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBU2sZEM4YFTHtE91UQto2EUElyU7UPzGTHyff7rLcI/edit?tab=t.0)[Previous](entry01.md) google doc. This has helped me find out what kind of stuff I'll be mentioning on my final website for the freedom project through giving me pretty significant details on how archaeology connects with SEP.
